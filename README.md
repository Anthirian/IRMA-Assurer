# IRMA Assurer
My master's thesis on the subject of the IRMA project. Assurer is a protocol I have designed for the scenario where a new applicant for an IRMA card needs to get started by adding attributes to his or her card. The fastest way to get started is to use the person's passport data and copy it over to the newly created IRMA card. This Assurer protocol needs to be cryptographically secure if it is going to be used for identification purposes. I use [ProVerif] to prove the model to be cryptographically secure and resistant to attacks.

## About IRMA

Digital attributes are properties that some authority states about you. It can be your age, your bank account number, or your right for some discount at a shop. What is new about these attributes is that you can carry these data items on one smart card conveniently and still disclose them independently.

Since the technology is protected by very strong cryptography, it provides security and privacy simultaneously. At last, you are in control of your attributes â€“ I Reveal My Attributes, or IRMA for short, makes this possible!

Currently IRMA is a cooperation project primarily between:

* [Radboud University Nijmegen]
* [SURFnet]
* [TNO]
* [SIDN]

Predecessor work to IRMA was funded by the [NLnet Foundation]. Currently, one of the project members, Pim Vullers, is funded by the [Open Ticketing Institute].

The IRMA project forms part of the [Privacy & Identity Lab].
