\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Terminology}
Tablets, from here on simply called clients.
Attribute data cryptographically signed by the server, from here on simply called attribute data (signing is implied).
IRMA card, simply called card.
Identity document with embedded chip like driver's license, ID card or passport. Denoted as passport for simplicity.
Authentication with respect to IRMA cards means the card is presented to a terminal (e.g. in a supermarket) which verifies the card user has the required attributes (e.g. age $\geq$ 18) for purchasing items (e.g. alcohol).
IRMA Assurer protocol, simply called Assurer.

\subsection{Motivation}
The IRMA card has a lot of potential. There are many use cases the card could improve upon. Assurer could potentially allow for a much quicker adaptation of the IRMA card. The reason for this is that most people already have an identity card or a passport that contains all their characteristics in one place. Leveraging this in order to quickly gather many attributes at once would be an ideal way to allow newcomers to get started. The passport or identity card generally holds the most generic characteristics, such as name, birthday, height and sex, making its conversion into attributes have immediate visual result.
