\subsection{Terminology}
Tablets, from here on simply called clients.
Attribute data cryptographically signed by the server, from here on simply called attribute data (signing is implied).
IRMA card, simply called card.
Identity document with embedded chip like driver's license, ID card or passport. Denoted as passport for simplicity.
Authentication with respect to IRMA cards means the card is presented to a terminal (e.g. in a supermarket) which verifies the card user has the required attributes (e.g. age $\geq$ 18) for purchasing items (e.g. alcohol).
