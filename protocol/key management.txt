Key			crypto type		Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pkSE		assymmetric		Public key of Server. Used for encrypting messages to allow only Server to read.
skSE		assymmetric		Secret key of Server. Used for decrypting received messages.
pkCE		assymmetric		Public key of Client. Used for encrypting messages to allow only Client to read.
skCE		assymmetric		Secret key of Client. Used for decrypting received messages.
pkSS		assymmetric		Public key of Server. Used for verifying received messages.
skSS		assymmetric		Secret key of Server. Used for signing messages.
Kts			symmetric		Session key generated by TLS 1.2. Ephemeral, so discarded after session. 

In short, server has two keypairs. One keypair is used for signing and verifying certificates generated during initialization of new clients, while the other is used for encryption and decryption of messages. Client has only one keypair used for encryption and decryption of messages. After the TLS handshake finishes, both parties have the same symmetric key to be used to encrypt and decrypt communications between them. This key is discarded at the end of the session, in order to achieve PFS.
