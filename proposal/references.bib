  abstract={Attribute-based credentials (ABCs) are building blocks for user-centric identity management. They enable the disclosure of a minimum amount of information about their owner to a verifier, typically a service provider, to authorise the credential owner for some service, application, or resource.

By directly applying attribute-disclosure protocols, the data is revealed not only to the verifier, but anyone who has access to the communication channel. Moreover, as verifiers are not intrinsically authenticated, one can accidentally reveal attributes to the wrong party. Therefore, a secure channel has to be established between the prover and the verifier.

Although efficient ABC smart-card implementations exist, not always can they perform all prover features. An equality proof, for instance, is essential in creating pseudonyms that enable temporary identification and eventually establishing a channel. Without this feature, other techniques have to be developed. In this paper we apply a more general notion of authentication that does not require card identification or pseudonyms. Based on this concept, we propose a security model that includes mutual authentication and setting up a channel between a card and a verifier. We present two efficient and provably secure protocols under standard assumptions in the random oracle model.}

  abstract={Attribute-based credentials are cryptographically secured carriers of properties that hold for a particular individual. They are the basic building blocks of many upcoming privacy-enhancing technologies and user-centric identity management systems. There are a number of limitations and requirements besides security and privacy, such as usability and efficiency, that have to be taken into account when designing specific credentials in practice.

This paper elaborates several realistic on-line and off-line use cases in attribute-based identity management; moreover, it identifies and analyses some of the design issues that require a decision or solution. It provides the most important credential design principles and also shows how setting up an attribute-based credential system formalises identity relationships in society.}
